# Django Bot
## sample sms (twilio)

This was a project with a 2nd year class in python.

The first time:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhildred/djangobot.git .
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Then:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

The idea in class was to modify the `sms/models.py` to make a use case of your choice related to takeaway.
